    <p>About a year ago, I experienced something that changed my life. A friend introduced me to HTML and CSS while we were discussing ideas to pass time and stay busy during the upcoming winter. Lo and behold, a simple start on <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/">Team Treehouse</a> pulled me into a whole new world.</p>

    <p>After completing the first course, building a basic photo gallery, I quickly took to the trusty internet in search of schools and programs that could teach me these skills. I wanted hands on experience, and I found that at <a href="http://www.grandcircus.co/" target="#_blank">Grand Circus, Detroit</a>.</p>

    <p>Over the course of eight weeks, I was bombarded with an intense amount of information. The instructor was amazing as he took his seat in the front of the class and performed magic with lines of letters and numbers. He taught me HTML and CSS basics, using Bootstrap to make sites responsive and mobile friendly. He taught JavaScript for interaction with the browser, jQuery for those sweet shortcuts, Angular (the powerful beast I used for this resume), and Git to manage my projects and builds.</p>

    <p>Once the lessons were taught, the labs were completed, and our finals projects had been demoed, it was time to start scribing the next chapter of my life. Two months after my class, I returned to <a href="http://www.grandcircus.co/" target="#_blank">Grand Circus, Detroit</a>. This time however, I was no longer the student, but instead an assistant instructor. Students were able to come to me for all sorts of help, ranging from structuring their first if/else statements, explaining the various loops, and learning the ropes when it came to awesome tools such as Gulp and Git.</p>
